# Master Spend

This project is a study that seeks to find a **financial control solution** for the user, recording their expenses and earnings and providing insights through graphs and tables.

Developed during the undergraduate course in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **FIAP**, this repository contains the progress of each stage of the development of the proposed project divided into phases.

## 1 - Development Environment

Throughout this phase, we acquired the knowledge and techniques necessary to initiate an agile app development project. We studied the initial steps in software development, agile practices such as **SCRUM**, and requirements gathering techniques.

We were also challenged to prepare the [Vision Document](/docs/1_vision_document.md) using the Moore Model (**Elevator Pitch**), which will serve as the foundation for creating our project's **Product Backlog**. Additionally, we were tasked with developing our first draft of [User Story Mapping](/docs/1_story_mapping.md).

Finally, an introduction to the **Python** language was presented, covering explanations of algorithms, data types, and operators.
