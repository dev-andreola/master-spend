# Master Spend

This project is a study that seeks to find a **financial control solution** for the user, recording their expenses and earnings and providing insights through graphs and tables.

Developed during the undergraduate course in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **FIAP**, this repository contains the progress of each stage of the development of the proposed project divided into phases.

## 1 - Development Environment

Throughout this phase, we acquired the knowledge and techniques necessary to initiate an agile app development project. We studied the initial steps in software development, agile practices such as **SCRUM**, and requirements gathering techniques.

We were also challenged to prepare the [Vision Document](/docs/1-vision-document.md) using the Moore Model (**Elevator Pitch**), which will serve as the foundation for creating our project's **Product Backlog**. Additionally, we were tasked with developing our first draft of [User Story Mapping](/docs/1-story-mapping.md).

Finally, an introduction to the **Python** language was presented, covering explanations of algorithms, data types, and operators.

## 2 - Prototyping

During Phase 2, we will move forward with detailed system design documentation, deepening our knowledge in **time and cost management**. Furthermore, we will begin the study of UML (Unified Modeling Language), starting with the **Use Case Diagram** to visualize and model the system requirements.

We also build the [application prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/ZeCkkVX6UapOQJgBkyMNfc/Fintech?node-id=0-1), using **wireframes** or drawings to define the structure of the screens. We learned important **UX** concepts and developed the first Master Spend screens with the **Figma** design tool.

At the same time, we deepened our studies in **Python** and were challenged to solve several real problems using the language. Below, I present some of the challenges and solutions I developed:

- [Voting Algorithm](/challenges/2-voting-algorithm.py)
- [Interest Table for Vehicle Financing](/challenges/2-vehicle-interest-table.py)
- [Debt Interest Table](/challenges/2-debt-interest-table.py)
- [Income Tax Calculator](/challenges/2-income-tax-calculator.py)

## 3 - Modeling

Database Modeling and Structuring: **Entity-Relationship Modeling**, Aggregation, Normalization, and Physical Model Development. We understand the effective use of databases, applying appropriate methods and **best practices** for efficient data storage.

During this phase I was challenged to create a **logical data model** of a [contact book](/challenges/3-contact-book-db), using Oracle Data Modeler I was able to graphically represent concepts such as entities, attributes and relationships.

In another interesting project that was proposed, I developed the complete [Fintech data model](/challenges/3-fintech-db), which allowed me to create and visualize the project's infrastructure.

## 4 - View

At this stage, I learned **how the internet works**. Concepts such as TCP/IP protocols, servers, domains, world wide web and SEO made me understand the internet processes more clearly.

Soon after, I was introduced in detail to HTML, the markup language **used to insert content** into websites. Very important concepts such as semantic HTML, forms, accessibility and SEO were emphasized.

CSS was presented next, with practical examples of integration with HTML and the construction of **responsive layouts and designs**.
