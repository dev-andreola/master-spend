# Master Spend

This project is a study that seeks to find a **financial control solution** for the user, recording their expenses and earnings and providing insights through graphs and tables.

Developed during the undergraduate course in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **FIAP**, this repository contains the progress of each stage of the development of the proposed project divided into phases.

## 1 - Development Environment

Throughout this phase, we acquired the knowledge and techniques necessary to initiate an agile app development project. We studied the initial steps in software development, agile practices such as **SCRUM**, and requirements gathering techniques.

We were also challenged to prepare the [Vision Document](/docs/1_vision_document.md) using the Moore Model (**Elevator Pitch**), which will serve as the foundation for creating our project's **Product Backlog**. Additionally, we were tasked with developing our first draft of [User Story Mapping](/docs/1_story_mapping.md).

Finally, an introduction to the **Python** language was presented, covering explanations of algorithms, data types, and operators.

## 2 - Prototyping

During Phase 2, we will move forward with detailed system design documentation, deepening our knowledge in **time and cost management**. Furthermore, we will begin the study of UML (Unified Modeling Language), starting with the **Use Case Diagram** to visualize and model the system requirements.

We also build the [application prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/ZeCkkVX6UapOQJgBkyMNfc/Fintech?node-id=0-1)
, using **wireframes** or drawings to define the structure of the screens. We learned important **UX** concepts and developed the first Master Spend screens with the **Figma** design tool.

At the same time, we deepened our studies in **Python** and were challenged to solve several real problems using the language. Below, I present some of the challenges and solutions I developed:

- [Voting Algorithm](/challenges/2_voting_algorithm.py)
- [Interest Table for Vehicle Financing](/challenges/2_vehicle_interest_table.py)
- [Debt Interest Table](/challenges/2_debt_interest_table.py)
- [Income Tax Calculator](/challenges/2_income_tax_calculator.py)
